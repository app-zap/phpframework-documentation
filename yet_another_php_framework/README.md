# Yet another PHP framework?

Yes. We were looking for a modern but lightweight PHP framework which fulfills the following:

* Supports *Domain Driven Design*
* Supports *composer*
* Has an easy and extendable templating engine
* Low configuration effort
* Low resources consumption

We like [Flow](http://flow.typo3.org/home), but it's too resource hungry. We were already using the original PHPFramework, which did not cover all of the needs, but hat some good approaches - so we build our framework on top of it.
